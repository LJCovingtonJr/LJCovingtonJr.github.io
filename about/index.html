<h1 id="my-name">My Name</h1>
<p>Keeping with the practice — popular among those working with language — of describing the pronunciation and meaning of my name, I’ve decided to do so here. My full name, LaRoyce Jermaine Covington, Jr., is pronounced:</p>
<center>
<p><font size = 5> / lɑ: ˌrɔɪs dʒərˈmeɪn ˈkəvɪŋtən / ˈdʒuːnjə / </font></p>
<p>Please forgive my poor attempt at IPA.</p>
</center>
<p>My first name, <strong>LaRoyce</strong>, comes from proud <a href="https://archive.org/details/babynamesnow00rose">African-American naming traditions</a>.</p>
<p>I sometimes go by my middle name, <strong>Jermaine</strong>, from the French <em>Germain</em> which in turn comes from the Latin <em>Germanus</em>, meaning “brother”.</p>
<p>My surname, <strong>Covington</strong>, has a disputed early history, with Scottish, English, and Latin having some claim to the name.</p>
<p>Finally, I keep a suffix — <strong>Junior</strong>. This simply indicates that I share my name with my father, who keeps the corresponding suffix <em>Senior</em>.</p>
<h1 id="model-united-nations">Model United Nations</h1>
<p>I have participated in Model United Nations since I was in high school, and most recently have served on the other side of the dais for the <a href="https://www.fhsmun.org">Florida High Schools Model United Nations</a> and their associated conferences.</p>

<p><img src="/./about_files/LJCovingtonJr_Fencing.jpeg" alt="LaRoyce Covington Jr, wearing a fencing uniform." style="width:20%; border:5px solid" align="left"/> Pre-COVID, I was a member of the USF Judo Club.  I had a fantastic time with the club and it went a long way toward getting me into shape.  I even earned my <em>rokkyū</em> (yellow belt) about a month before the first COVID-induced lockdown! <img src="/./about_files/usfjudo.jpg" alt="A group of members of the USF Judo Club.  LaRoyce Covington Jr is in the middle row, second from the left, wearing the traditional judogi tied with a yellow belt" style="width:20%; border:5px solid" align="right"/></p>
<p>Frustratingly, Judo opportunities at Syracuse aren&rsquo;t really available.  I&rsquo;ve still found myself having a lovely time with the Syracuse University Fencing Club!  I&rsquo;ve tried fencing on and off in the past and I&rsquo;ve come to really enjoy it.</p>
