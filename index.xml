      <description>My Name Keeping with the practice — popular among those working with language — of describing the pronunciation and meaning of my name, I’ve decided to do so here. My full name, LaRoyce Jermaine Covington, Jr., is pronounced:
 / lɑ: ˌrɔɪs dʒərˈmeɪn ˈkəvɪŋtən / ˈdʒuːnjə / 
Please forgive my poor attempt at IPA.
 Model United Nations I have participated in Model United Nations since I was in high school, and most recently have served on the other side of the dais for the Florida High Schools Model United Nations and their associated conferences.</description>
