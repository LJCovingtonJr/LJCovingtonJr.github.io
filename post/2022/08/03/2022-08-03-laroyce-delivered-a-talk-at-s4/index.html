<p>I was invited by Drs. <a href="https://acuna.io/">Daniel Acuna</a> and <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/people/stephen-v-david-phd">Stephen David</a> to deliver a presentation on knowledge graphs for the <a href="https://s4.scienceofscience.org/">Science of Science Summer School</a> (S4). You can find a video of the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NPAOAFNxfc">here</a> and my slidedeck is available via Google Slides <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YFIrRg5XUF4qg2Sjhq03gXs_romCxD1NrnYyW3cvNN4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>I was <em>intensely</em> nervous – and I’m sure it showed! – but I’m happy to have done it. I was actually able to spur some discussion, which was nice given my fear that I’d be rambling on and on with an increasingly confused audience.</p>
