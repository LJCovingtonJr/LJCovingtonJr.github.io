I was invited by Drs. [Daniel Acuna](https://acuna.io/) and [Stephen David](https://www.ohsu.edu/people/stephen-v-david-phd) to deliver a presentation on knowledge graphs for the [Science of Science Summer School](https://s4.scienceofscience.org/) (S4).  You can find a video of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NPAOAFNxfc) and my slidedeck is available via Google Slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YFIrRg5XUF4qg2Sjhq03gXs_romCxD1NrnYyW3cvNN4/edit?usp=sharing).  

I was *intensely* nervous -- and I'm sure it showed! -- but I'm happy to have done it.  I was actually able to spur some discussion, which was nice given my fear that I'd be rambling on and on with an increasingly confused audience.
