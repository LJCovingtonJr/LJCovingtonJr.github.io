<p>I had the pleasure today of giving a poster presentation at the <a href="https://www.ic2s2.org/">International Conference on Computation Social Science</a> at the University of Chicago. I was presenting on our project regarding the use of knowledge graphs for innovation prediction. My poster can be found <a href="/ic2s2poster.pdf">here</a>. I’m quite proud of it. I used Mike Morrison’s <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemorrison/status/1110191245035479041"><em>Betterposter</em></a> design scheme and I think it did a better job of communicating the project to passers-by.</p>
